### Dendritic glutamate imaging

Combining high-speed two-photon imaging and glutamate sensors provides a way to monitor synaptic inputs to any given neuron. Mapping anatomically defined synapses and measuring receptive fields of said synapses during behavior is a powerful method to characterizing how a neuron transforms its input parameters.


### In vivo voltage imaging

The strength of voltage imaging lies in its ability to monitor the membrane potential, including subthreshold activity, in dozens of neurons simultaneously. This type of measurement cannot be accomplished by other methods, save for laborious multi-patching. Measuring subthreshold activity during behavior offers subtle clues as to how the network wires and fires.
