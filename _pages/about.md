About
======

I am an MD/PhD student in the Johns Hopkins Medical Scientist Training Program. My research interests lie in sensorimotor circuits and their computations. As a grad student in neuroscience, I aim to study sensorimotor circuits at multiple conceptual levels: its algorithm in the context of behavior, its implementation in neurons, and its shaping through experience. What a neural circuit does, what mechanisms are responsible, and how it reconfigures through experience are my primary questions. 

Sydney Brenner once remarked, “Progress in science depends on techniques, new discoveries and new ideas, probably in that order.” My previous research has been primarily in the first step of neuroscience: tool development. During my gap year before med school, I worked in Podgorski Lab, HHMI Janelia Research Campus and worked on glutamate dendritic imaging to identify projection-specific monosynaptic inputs in cortical neurons. I got to play with [one of the fastest two-photon microscopes ever built](https://www.janelia.org/news/slap-microscopy-smashes-speed-barriers). At Harvard, I worked on [voltage imaging](https://medium.com/the-spike/what-should-systems-neuroscience-do-next-voltage-imaging-9bfa5d6a4df9) to study network dynamics during rodent navigation.
